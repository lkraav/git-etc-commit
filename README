git-etc-commit 0.3, Leho Kraav <leho@kraav.com> https://github.com/lkraav/git-etc-commit

This git helper command is a Gentoo-specific /etc management tool. It attempts to aid system administrator
in keeping a neat log of all configuration changes in a git repository.

Install:
	emerge portage-utils 
	clone repo somewhere, symlink to /usr/local/bin or whatever else is in your PATH.

Use:
	cd /etc
	git etc-commit

Features include:
 * being very careful and always asking before committing any changes to filesystem
 * killable at any time without leaving repository in inconsistent state
 * automatic discovery of new files in working directory, what package they belong to
   and finding their in-package companions
 * can detect package upgrades (new files for packages with already existing files in git history)

Hint: for rebasing live /etc, use git new-workdir to create a new shared history clone 
somewhere else. If you try editing early commits directly in live /etc with git rebase -i,
you will have lots of unwanted fun, I promise
